You know the following about Nonograms:
- Numbers, shown on the left and above the crossword - describe the groups of painted squares (which go in sequence, no blanks) horizontally and vertically accordingly. The order of these numbers describes the order of location of these groups, but it is unknown where each group starts and finishes (in fact it is the task of the puzzle to define their location). Each separate number means a separate group of the given size (i.e. number 5 - means a group of five painted squares in sequence, 1 - a group of only one painted square). The groups are separated by at least one empty square.
- The main requirement to Nonograms is that the crossword should have only one logical solution, achieved without any “guessing” (method of trial and error).

How to solve Nonograms:
- To solve a Nonogram a person should look at each line/column separately, always moving to the next columns and lines. In so doing the process of solving in each line/column comes to the following:
- To define the squares which are sure to be painted (with any possible location of the groups) - so we fill them.
- To define the squares in which it is impossible to have painted squares - such squares are marked with a cross (sometimes a bullet point is used instead of a cross).
To define the numbers, which location is already identified - usually these numbers are crossed out.
